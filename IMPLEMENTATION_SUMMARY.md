### Lambda Functions
1. **Task Starter** (`starter.ts`): Handles task submission and queue routing
2. **Task Status** (`status.ts`): Provides real-time task status and results
3. **Task Scheduler** (`scheduler.ts`): Batch processing and priority management
4. **Task Monitor** (`monitor.ts`): Health checks, cleanup, and metrics collection
5. **Task Completion** (`completion.ts`): Handles task completion events
